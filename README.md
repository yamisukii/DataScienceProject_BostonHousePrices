# DataScienceProject_BostonHousePrices
In this project, we analyze the Boston Housing dataset to gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing housing prices in Boston. Our objective is to test various machine learning models and a simple neural network to find the best method for predicting the median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV).

Throughout this process, we will:

 - Explore the data and identify key features.
 - Apply data preprocessing techniques to prepare the data for modeling.
 - Build and train various machine learning models and a neural network.
 - Evaluate and compare the models to determine the most effective one.
 - Clearly communicate the key findings and conclusions.

This project aims not only to improve the accuracy of house price predictions but also to enhance our skills in data analysis, machine learning, and result communication.
