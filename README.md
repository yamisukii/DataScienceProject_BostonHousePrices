# DataScienceProject_BostonHousePrices
In this project, we analyze the Boston Housing dataset to gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing housing prices in Boston. Our objective is to test various machine learning models and a simple neural network to find the best method for predicting the median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV).
